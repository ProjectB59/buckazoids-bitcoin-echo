            Buckazoids launched on March 27th, 2025 — still early in its valuation and market cap.
            Bitcoin is now worth over a trillion dollars. Imagine what happens when this story reaches the masses.

              We believe Buckazoids is the spiritual predecessor to Bitcoin. It's built for 
              the future, it's built to scale, and most importantly — it's just getting started.
