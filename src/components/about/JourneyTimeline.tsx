              You've been deep in crypto. Scrolling charts, chasing memecoins, wondering who Satoshi Nakamoto really is.
              Maybe even kicking yourself for missing Bitcoin when it was just a whisper on the internet.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              What if the origin story was hiding in plain sight all along?

              This isn't another crypto site. This is Buckazoids: a forgotten piece of gaming history, reborn on-chain, and maybe your second shot at catching lightning in a bottle.
